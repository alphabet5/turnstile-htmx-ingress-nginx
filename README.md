# turnstile-htmx-ingress-nginx
 A simple turnstile validation using ingress-nginx.

## Overview

This is a simple example of validating a turnstile challenge using ingress-nginx.

If the turnstile validation passes, lua in ingress-nginx will validate the challenge, and send the request on to the server which will respond with `You're probably human! Good luck.` Other responses are generated by lua. Typically they would be 403's, but here I'm using 200 so the response content can be easily swapped into the webpage.
